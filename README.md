📝 Conclusion:
❌ Shipping costs were not aligned with order priorities.
High-priority orders were not consistently shipped via faster methods (e.g. Express Air), and low-priority orders used costly shipping options.
📌 Recommendation: Optimize shipping mode selection based on both cost and urgency to improve efficiency.

✅ Final Recommendations:
•	Align shipping methods with order priorities
•	Focus promotions on low-revenue regions and customers
•	Personalize product offerings for top buyers
•	Leverage Technology category trends
•	Improve return handling and customer satisfaction
